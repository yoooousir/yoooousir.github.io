- name: SQLFeatureGen
  descr: "A feature engineering project built on structured log data, using advanced SQL queries combined with Python-based transformation. The project demonstrates how to derive session-based behavioral features, detect anomalous traffic using pattern matching and aggregations, and prepare model-ready features using pandas. Also includes exploratory data analysis notebooks to extract meaningful insights from raw logs."

- name: GridTune-Parallel
  descr: "A multithreaded hyperparameter tuning system that leverages C's pthread library to parallelize grid search over different hyperparameter combinations. Each thread executes a Python subprocess to train a dummy classification model with specific parameters. All experiment results are tracked and visualized using MLflow, enabling systematic selection of the best-performing configuration."

- name: PacketNet-Detector
  descr: "A lightweight intrusion detection system prototype that parses raw network packet logs using a C-based parser and applies a TensorFlow CNN model for attack classification. It simulates a real-world packet analysis pipeline by extracting IP, port, protocol, and flag features via bitwise operations and struct parsing, then feeding them into a deep learning model for binary classification of malicious behavior."

#- name: 10-CNN based Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)
 # descr: "Developed and trained a 10-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) for speech emotion recognition (SER) using datasets such as RAVDESS, CREMA-D, TESS, and SAVEE. The model processes audio features extracted from speech data and achieves approximately 95% accuracy in classifying emotions."

- name: GraphRAG-Based Research-Article Retrieval
  descr: "Designed and implemented a framework to automate the retrieval, parsing, and storage of research articles based on user-defined search queries or keywords. Leveraged PUBMED and EuropePMC APIs to download PDF and XML papers, parsed them, and saved the results as Parquet files in Azure Blob Storage. Integrated this data with a GraphRAG system, enabling the retrieval of the most relevant answers based on user input. The GraphRAG system was built using the LangChain framework and Neo4j database, with Cypher queries for efficient graph traversal."

- name: "Cheat'em in Texas"
  descr: "Designed and implemented the UI/UX and customized C# scripts for an Oculus-based VR game using Unity, featuring a poker-themed cheating scenario where players aim to achieve a target amount in a Texas Hold'em casino setting. Configured the XR Interaction Toolkit and Meta XR SDK to create intuitive interfaces and interactions, enabling players to seamlessly act as both the dealer and player while executing sleight-of-hand tricks. Contributed to gameplay mechanics and integrated dynamic AI opponents using Barracuda and ONNX, delivering an immersive and engaging user experience."
