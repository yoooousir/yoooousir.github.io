- name: 10-CNN based Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)
  descr: "Developed and trained a 10-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) for speech emotion recognition (SER) using datasets such as RAVDESS, CREMA-D, TESS, and SAVEE. The model processes audio features extracted from speech data and achieves approximately 95% accuracy in classifying emotions."

- name: GraphRAG based Research-Article Recommendation
  descr: "Designed and implemented a framework to automate the retrieval, parsing, and storage of research articles based on user-defined search queries or keywords. Leveraged PUBMED and EuropePMC APIs to download PDF and XML papers, parsed them, and saved the results as Parquet files in Azure Blob Storage. Integrated this data with a GraphRAG system, enabling the retrieval of the most relevant answers based on user input. The GraphRAG system was built using the LangChain framework and Neo4j database, with Cypher queries for efficient graph traversal."
